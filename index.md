## Stock Viewer application summary

This application will get the monthly stock prices of the company specified with its SYMBOL, and create a time series chart of prices or returns depending on the check box. Information will be collected from Yahoo! online in the period from 1998-01-01 to 2014-10-31. When the check box is Off (initial), the monthly adjusted closing prices will be displayed. If On, the monthly continuously compounded returns will be displayed along with the expected annual return and volatility in %.

The next three slides show
